<u>Overview:</u>


• Lightweight Scheduler App built on Skeleton CSS, Moment JS and Jquery.

• Stylish 1980s Pastel Coloring.

• Scalable, mobile ready with @media queries.

• Real Time Color Scheme based on the hour of the day the application is accessed.

• Application allows for a single event to be recorded for each business hour of the day (07:00 -> 17:00).

• Open index.html in your browser.


• Fill any text field with an event of your choice.


• Press the "+" sign on the right side of the text field to save the event in question.


• Refresh the page, your event information will still appear and will not be erased.


• Calendar is built in **real-time** with 3 colored regions:

	
	1) The dark blue color region indicates all the business hours of the day (if any) that precede the exact moment you're looking at the application. (past)


	2) The reddish region indicates the present moment you're looking at the application. (present)


	3) The pure cyan color region indicates all the business hours of the day (if any) that are ahead of the exact moment you're looking at the application. (future)
